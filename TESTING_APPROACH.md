# Systematic Testing Approach for Kyverno n4k + Reports Server

## Testing Strategy Overview

This document outlines a **phased testing approach** to systematically validate Kyverno n4k + Reports Server before scaling to production workloads.

## Phase 1: Small-Scale EKS Cluster (Current)

### Cluster Specifications
- **Instance Type**: t3a.medium (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM)
- **Node Count**: 2 nodes
- **Expected Capacity**: ~110 pods total
- **Purpose**: Requirements gathering, monitoring setup, test case validation

### Goals for Phase 1
1. ✅ **Validate EKS deployment** - Ensure basic EKS cluster works
2. ✅ **Test Kyverno n4k installation** - Verify enhanced features work
3. ✅ **Test Reports Server integration** - Validate separate etcd storage
4. ✅ **Setup monitoring stack** - Configure Prometheus/Grafana
5. ✅ **Create test cases** - Develop comprehensive test scenarios
6. ✅ **Performance baseline** - Establish baseline metrics
7. ✅ **Resource requirements** - Determine actual resource needs

## Phase 2: Medium-Scale Testing (Next)

### Cluster Specifications
- **Instance Type**: m5.large (2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM)
- **Node Count**: 5-10 nodes
- **Expected Capacity**: ~500-1,000 pods
- **Purpose**: Performance testing, scaling validation

## Phase 3: Production-Scale Testing (Final)

### Cluster Specifications
- **Instance Type**: m5.2xlarge (8 vCPU, 32 GB RAM)
- **Node Count**: 20+ nodes
- **Expected Capacity**: 12,000 pods across 1,425 namespaces
- **Purpose**: Production workload validation

## Test Cases to Validate

### 1. Basic Functionality Tests
- [ ] Kyverno n4k installation and startup
- [ ] Reports Server installation and connectivity
- [ ] Policy application and enforcement
- [ ] Policy report generation
- [ ] etcd storage functionality

### 2. Monitoring Tests
- [ ] Prometheus metrics collection
- [ ] Grafana dashboard functionality
- [ ] Alert configuration and testing
- [ ] Metrics accuracy and completeness

### 3. Performance Tests
- [ ] Pod creation rate under policy enforcement
- [ ] Policy evaluation latency
- [ ] Report generation latency
- [ ] etcd storage performance
- [ ] Resource utilization patterns

### 4. Scale Tests
- [ ] Multiple namespace creation
- [ ] Multiple policy application
- [ ] Concurrent pod creation
- [ ] Policy report volume handling

### 5. Failure Scenarios
- [ ] Node failure recovery
- [ ] etcd failure recovery
- [ ] Policy misconfiguration handling
- [ ] Resource exhaustion scenarios

## Success Criteria for Phase 1

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ All components install successfully
- ✅ Policies enforce correctly
- ✅ Reports generate and store properly
- ✅ Monitoring provides accurate metrics
- ✅ Basic performance meets expectations

### Technical Requirements
- ✅ Resource usage within expected limits
- ✅ No critical errors in logs
- ✅ All services healthy and responsive
- ✅ Metrics collection working properly
- ✅ Dashboards displaying data correctly

## Resource Requirements Analysis

### What We Need to Measure
1. **CPU Usage**: Per component and total cluster
2. **Memory Usage**: Per component and total cluster
3. **Storage Usage**: etcd and persistent volumes
4. **Network Usage**: API calls and data transfer
5. **Pod Density**: Maximum pods per node
6. **Policy Processing**: Time per policy evaluation

### Baseline Metrics to Collect
- Pod creation rate (pods/minute)
- Policy evaluation latency (milliseconds)
- Report generation time (seconds)
- etcd storage growth rate (MB/hour)
- API request rate (requests/second)

## Next Steps After Phase 1

1. **Analyze results** from small-scale testing
2. **Adjust specifications** based on actual resource usage
3. **Refine test cases** based on findings
4. **Plan Phase 2** with updated requirements
5. **Document lessons learned** for scaling

This phased approach ensures we validate everything systematically before committing to the full-scale production testing.
